    Web design refers to the process of designing the visual appearance and
    layout of websites. It involves creating a visual concept, planning the
    layout of web pages, selecting color schemes, and choosing typography
    and images.

    appealing and user-friendly websites. These tools include graphic design
    software such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Sketch, and Figma.

    Web development refers to the process of creating websites and web applications. This
    involves a combination of different technologies and programming languages, such as HTML,
    CSS, and JavaScript, to create web
    pages and make them interactive.
    <br />
    Web development can be divided into two main categories: front-end development and
    back-end development. Front-end development deals with the visual aspects of a website or
    application, including the design, layout, and user interface. This involves working with
    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create web pages that can be viewed in a browser.
